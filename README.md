### Hello, I'm Chethana 👋 

### 🌈 About me
I'm a software engineer residing in sunny California. I enjoy learning, solving problems, and spending my free time experimenting with new cuisines and flavors in the kitchen and exploring beautiful scenic places.

I have been working as a softare engineer (full-stack) for about 3 years at realtor.com, primarily working with these tools: Flask, React, FastAPI, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, AWS and ElasticSearch.
Before this, I did my masters in Computer Science at SUNY Binghamton. 

Also worked for 2 years in India as a software engineer in test at Wolters Kluwer working with Selenium, Groovy, Cucumber, manual and automation testing methodologies.  

💪 One of my superpowers: I am really good at root causing (whether its a small bug or a massive outage), finding a solution and moving forward.
