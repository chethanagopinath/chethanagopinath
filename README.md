### Hello, I'm Chethana 👋 

Welcome to my corner of the web! :)

### 🌈 About me
I'm a software engineer residing in sunny California. I enjoy learning, solving problems, and spending my free time experimenting with new cuisines and flavors in the kitchen and exploring beautiful scenic places.

I have been working as a softare engineer (full-stack) for about 3 years at realtor.com, primarily working with these tools: Flask, React, FastAPI, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres and AWS.
Before this, I did my masters in Computer Science in New York. 

Also worked for 2 years in India as a software engineer in test at Wolters Kluwer.  

💪 One of my superpowers: I am really good at root causing (whether its a small bug or a massive outage), finding a solution and moving forward.
